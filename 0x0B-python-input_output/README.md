Python



Python is an awesome programming language because it is versatile and easy to use. It has built-in functions for opening, writing, and reading files, as well as for manipulating the cursor. It is important to remember to close a file after using it to prevent data loss. The with statement is a convenient way to make sure that files are closed automatically. JSON is a data format for storing and exchangingdata. Serialization is the process of converting a Python data structure into a JSON string, while deserialization is the process of converting a JSON string into a Python data structure. Python's built-in json module provides functions for serializing and deserializing Python data structures into JSON strings.
