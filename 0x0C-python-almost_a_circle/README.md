Unit testing is a way to ensure that individual units within a project are working correctly. It can be implemented by writing test cases that check the behavior of the code in different scenarios. To serialize and deserialize a Class, an ObjectMapper like Jackson can be used to convert it into a JSON string. To write and read a JSON file, the fopen() and fwrite() functions can be used. *args is used to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function, while **kwargs is used to pass an arbitrary set of keyword arguments. To handle named arguments, the ** operator can be used to unpack keyword arguments into a function.

This project explores this testing using different exercises.
