Relational database model design is a process used to structure data in a way that allows for efficient access and manipulation. It involves normalization and entity-relationship (ER) modeling. Normalization is a process of breaking down complex data into smaller and simpler parts in order to organize it efficiently. ER modeling is a process of creating a conceptual model to represent data in the form of entities, which are objects or concepts, and the relationships between them. Through the use of ER modeling, data can be organized and structured in a way that is easier to access and manipulate.

For this project the task required writing up ssripts that could increase efficiency whem accessing data to either manipulate or just read from it to gain insights relevant to the query made.
