This project provides an overview of how to use the Python packages urllib and requests to fetch internet resources. It covers how to use urllib to decode the body response, how to make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other requests, and how to fetch JSON resources and manipulate data from an external service. By the end of the project, expectations had it that we'd be able to use the urllib and requests packages to fetch internet resources with Python.
